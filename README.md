Hardware
* Intel Movidius NCS: We stripped the NCS to minimize the space it takes in the device.
Raspberry Pi Zero W: We used the Raspberry Pi Zero because it is a cheaply available microprocessor that is commonly used by developers. 
* Bone Conduction Transducer from Adafruit:
* Microphone: Though we did not integrate a microphone in our final device design, this microphone (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IR8R7WQ/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1) is compatible with our hardware and is also supported by our software for taking audio input
* Flexible camera: We used a small flexible spy camera (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B012QRGUCQ/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1) that looks small on the earlobe (6mm diameter Utkarsh?), has a long flex cable (30 cm) to connect it to the Raspberry Pi, and is compatible with raspberry pi zero using a camera cable extender (https://www.adafruit.com/product/3671) and flex extension cable (Utkarsh? link)
* Battery and power circuit (links for both Utkarsh? + approx battery life/usage breakdown ). The battery has an approximate battery life of x hours.
The board designs for the wearable trigger are here, including the components list (https://github.com/minakhan01/PAL_Paper1_external/tree/master/RingTouchTrigger)
* The 3D models of PAL ring, hub and ear-worn device can be found here: https://github.com/minakhan01/PAL_Paper1_external/tree/master/3Dmodels . The devices were printed using FormLabs resin printed and could also be sent to Shapeways. Here are the 2 mm magnets used in the PAL hub: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0753ZPBLQ/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1
